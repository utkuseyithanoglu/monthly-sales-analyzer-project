### 🌱 How to start this project

Follow these instructions:

1. Create a new repository by forking the [Git project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/monthly-sales-analyzer-project) or [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/monthly-sales-analyzer-project/fork).
2. Open the newly created repository in Codespace using the [Codespace button extension](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).
3. Once the VSCode in Codespace has finished opening, start your project by following the instructions below.

## 📝 Instructions

You have been provided with a Python file (`monthly_sales_analyzer.py`) that contains sales data for a month for three products over 20 days. Your task is to complete the empty functions to analyze this data using basic Python skills: loops, conditionals, and data structures. This project will assess your ability to process and extract information from a dataset, preparing you for data science concepts.


- The data is stored in a variable called `sales_data`, a list of 20 dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a day and has:
   - `"day"`: Day number (1 to 20).
   - `"product_a"`: Sales of Product A.
   - `"product_b"`: Sales of Product B.
   - `"product_c"`: Sales of Product C.

Example: 

```python
{"day": 1, "product_a": 150, "product_b": 80, "product_c": 200}
```

- Complete the five placeholder functions in the file. 

- Each function analyzes the `sales_data` in a specific way. Use only basic Python, no external libraries. The file includes `print` statements to test your work.

#### Functions to Complete:  
- **`total_sales_by_product(data, product_key)`:** Calculate the total sales of a given product (e.g., `"product_a"`) over 20 days.


- **`average_daily_sales(data, product_key)`:** Calculate the average daily sales of a given product.


- **`best_selling_day(data)`:** Find the day with the highest total sales (sum of the three products).

- **`days_above_threshold(data, product_key, threshold)`:** Count how many days the sales of a product exceeded a given threshold (e.g., 18).

- **`top_product(data)`:** Identify which product (A, B, or C) had the highest total sales.

- To test your code, run the following command in the command line:

   ```bash
   python3 monthly_sales_analyzer.py
   ```

## Feeling confident? 😎:  
- Add a function to find the day with the worst sales.
- Sort the days by total sales and show the top 3.
- Calculate the range (maximum - minimum) of the sales of a product.

  
In the end, you will have practiced handling a realistic dataset with basic Python, developing skills for your next data science course. 

Have fun analyzing!🚀
